<li>Shangri-La, Elysium, Arcadia, Utopia and Bali are all synonymous with "heaven."</li> 
<li>The only difference between them is that you can actually visit Bali.</li>
<li>Many travelers have never been to this Indonesian island.</li>
<li>Yet, the word "Bali" conjures daydreams of the most fantastical landscape: towering volcanoes wrapped in a deep green canopy, sandy shores that fade into turquoise waters and curving coastlines crowned with staggered pagodas.</li>
<li>And believe it or not, Bali rarely disappoints.</li>
<li>You'll be amazed at how many different types of visitors revel in this paradise.</li>
<li>The ordinary traveler simply stays at the palatial oceanfront resort and indulges in luxurious spa treatments, decadent cuisine and lazy sunbathing. </li>
<li>But the historian will find his or her delights at the island's many temples while the adventurer will discover new paths up an active volcano in Kintamani.</li>
<li>Plus, the town of Kuta boasts more riotous pleasures for those inclined to late nights.</li>
<li>Bali is a dream come true, so wake up and book your ticket.</li>
