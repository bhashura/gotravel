<li>Porto has long been a hot destination for wine lovers — it's the go-to place to find the best of that sweet, tasty port wine.</li>
<li>But this city by the sea has more to offer than vinho.</li>
<li>Porto (or Oporto, as it's sometimes called) is an attractive European mini-metropolis on Portugal's northwestern coast where travelers can get their fill of culture and the outdoors. </li>
<li>Travelers can visit the city's wealth of museums, admire its varied architecture and, of course, hit the beach.
<li>The city earns its nickname Cidade das Pontes, or "City of Bridges," from the six arches spanning the Rio Douro (Douro River), which runs along Porto's southern edge.</li>
<li>Views of the Douro River are best enjoyed from the Dom Luís I Bridge, the most iconic of Porto's six structures. </li>
<li>From here you can get a sense of Porto's unique charm, from its colorful UNESCO World Heritage historic district to the north to the neighboring town of Vila Nova de Gaia just south, where you'll find the region's infamous wineries.</li>
<li>You could spend a long weekend or a week here strolling the city, discovering the contemporary art in the Serralves Foundation complex and appreciating the history behind Porto's old churches like the Sé and Igreja de São Francisco.</li>
<li>No matter what you choose to see and do in this captivating city, you'll leave with an appreciation of Porto's diverse offerings, some great photos and, hopefully, a bottle or two of its best wine.</li>
