                                <li style="text-align: left">A massive volcanic eruption around 1650 B.C. forced the center of what was then a single island to implode and succumb to the sea.</li> 
                                <li style="text-align: left">Some say that this was the original home of the lost city of Atlantis, which long ago disappeared into the ocean's depths.</li>
                                <li style="text-align: left">Whatever remains of this mythological metropolis is now guarded by beautiful beaches and stately whitewashed homes. </li>  
                                <li style="text-align: left">Today, Santorini consists of two inhabited islands and several islets.</li>
                                <li style="text-align: left">Most visitors spend their time on Thira (the archipelago's largest island), which is home to Santorini's major towns, including Fira and Oia.</li> 
                                <li style="text-align: left">Sleepy Thirassia makes for a relaxing daytrip too. And don't count out the quieter islands: Nea Kameni and Palea Kameni are worth exploring.</li>
                                <li style="text-align: left">Your first order of business in Santorini is to hit the colorful beaches â€“ the black and red sands make for a memorable visit.</li>
                                <li style="text-align: left">Next up, indulge in the archaeological delights of the impressively preserved Ancient Akrotiri or hike to Ancient Thera to see the ruins of three empires, including the Romans.</li>   
								<li style="text-align: left">From there, catch a breathtaking view of the caldera, a brilliant turquoise pool of water that serves as the nucleus for the varied isles of this archipelago.</li>
								<li style="text-align: left">Some would say you only need a day to enjoy these islands' charms (they are a popular port of call for cruise ships), but to really drink in all Santorini has to offer, you'll need a few days to a week.</li>	
								<li style="text-align: left">Then you'll have plenty of time to learn there's more to these comely dots of the Cyclades than meets the eye.</li>
