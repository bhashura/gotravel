<li>Lush, unspoiled St. Lucia has a growing fan base.</li> Some of its vacationers are music lovers, letting loose at the springtime St. Lucia Jazz & Arts Festival (which has previously featured headlining acts like Akon, Ziggy Marley, Diana Ross and the late Amy Winehouse).</li>
<li>Others are honeymooners, unwinding on one of the island's chalky beaches or holing up in one of the isolated couples resorts. </li>
<li>Still other patrons are adrenaline junkies, testing their limits climbing the Pitons or zip lining through the Chassin region's rain forest.</li>
<li>But what if you aren't any of these types? Don't worry: St. Lucia refuses to be pigeonholed as any "type" of Caribbean vacation.</li>
<li>Plus you also don't have to spend a lot of money (its reputation as a luxurious hideout is only somewhat warranted).</li>
<li>To discover some of the island's indescribable charms, you'll have to visit for yourself.</li>
<li>Start your mornings basking in an orange-tinted Soufrière sunrise then round out your evenings at an evening "jump-up" (or dance party) along Gros Islet. </li>
<li>We'll wait to hear what you think.</li>
