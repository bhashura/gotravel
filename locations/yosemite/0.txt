<li>One of California's most formidable natural landscapes, Yosemite National Park features nearly 1,200 square miles of sheer awe: towering waterfalls, millennia-old Sequoia trees, striking, daunting cliff faces and some of the most unique rock formations in the United States.</li> 
<li>But despite its enormous size, most of the tourist activity takes place within the 8-square-mile area of Yosemite Valley. </li>
<li>Here you'll find the park's most famous landmarks – Half Dome and El Capitan – as well as excellent hiking trails through the natural monuments.</li>
<li>Even inexperienced hikers can enjoy Yosemite: Guided tours and climbing lessons are available from local adventure outfitters.</li>
<li>Just don't expect to experience it by yourself.</li>
<li>Like so many other American tourist destinations, crowds are the biggest obstacles to an enjoyable Yosemite vacation – approximately 4 million people visit each year.</li>
<li>But if you go at the right time (and start your day a little earlier than usual), Mother Nature's wonders will reveal themselves to you in a miraculous and serene way.</li>
